# Before using Anchor module:
1. Do everything required by the README.md of the Solana module
2. Install Anchor on your terminal. You can find a guide here: https://solana.com/it/docs/intro/installation (the toolchain has been tested on Anchor 0.31.0)
3. Only if you are on Windows: install WSL

#### To use Anchor module: Launch user_interface and reach Anchor section through the menus.

# Available functionalities
### - Compile and eventually deploy new anchor programs
  - Put your Anchor programs in .rs format inside the "anchor_programs" folder of the Anchor module
  - The tool will guide you to compile and eventually deploy each program inside the "anchor_programs" directory
  - Please remove .rs file from the "anchor_programs" folder after deploying, or the next time you compile it will give you an error
### - Run functions of a compiled and deployed Anchor program (must be compiled and deployed through the given toolchain). It can be done via:
 #### - Interactive procedure:
- The tool will guide you for inserting the required parameters, also letting you know the required types
- It will launch the function with the given parameters, letting you know the transaction size and fees 
#### - Automatic procedure:
- An execution trace must be prepared and inserted in the "execution_traces" folder of the Anchor module. The execution trace must be a CSV file with a row for each trace. Each row must have this structure:
  - Trace ID (a number decided by you, it's just a reference for results)
  - Program name
  - Instruction name
  - The required accounts, written in this way:
    - If the account is a wallet (inside the "solana_wallet" folder), write W:<<wallet_name>> (please note that file extension must be included)
    - If the account is a PDA (you can generate it with the provided tool), write: P:<<pda_key>>
  - The required args (if it is an array, please insert values separated by spaces)
  - Provider wallet (this will be used to send transaction). Please write the name of the wallet file as: <<wallet_name>> with its file extension
  - True if you want to send the prepared transaction
- The output file will have the structure of:
  - Trace ID
  - Transaction size in bytes
  - Transaction fees in Lamports
  - If you wrote True to send transaction, transaction hash.
### - Utilities (most of them for generating execution traces)
- Get initialized programs
- Get program instructions
- Get instruction accounts (and if they are signer)
- Get instruction arguments (and types)
- Generate PDA keys
- Remove initialize Anchor Program (this will remove related initialization files generated by the toolchain)
- Close and remove initialized Anchor program

# Please note:
- Compiling may take a while, please be patient
- At the moment, the tool can only deal with classical parameter types (e.g. uint, int, float, string) and arrays. It can't deal with structs or other complex parameter types
